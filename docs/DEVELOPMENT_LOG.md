# Dr.Vas Development Log

## 2026-11-03 — Production homepage blank-blue startup incident

- User-visible symptom reported by founder: production site displays only the Dr.Vas wordmark, Romanian flag and language control; the remainder of the page is a plain blue screen and language control does not respond.
- The production Worker deployment at commit `ef43f9ca1a04e01a6937b3dd33e6096ae519bdac` had previously completed successfully, including its Worker health/homepage smoke test. This confirms the Worker response at deployment time, not full browser-side runtime health.
- Source inspection found the frontend initially rendered `#appMain` with `language-pending`, a fail-closed CSS state that hides all main content except the language gate until the bottom-of-page JavaScript calls `initLanguage()`. A runtime failure earlier in the inline script can prevent that call and leave the page hidden. This is a plausible failure mechanism; the precise runtime exception has not yet been observed because the founder cannot provide browser console output or screenshots.
- Hotfix branch: `hotfix/ui-startup-failsafe`.
- Frontend change in `www/index.html`: remove the initial fail-closed class from the HTML shell, and add a global runtime-error fallback that removes `language-pending` and marks the header status as partially available. Normal language initialization still applies its pending state when the language-selection gate is intentionally required.
- Validation performed in the connected development environment: extracted all non-empty inline scripts from the updated HTML and successfully parsed them with the JavaScript engine; verified the initial app shell no longer starts with `language-pending` and the runtime fallback is present.
- Pull request: https://github.com/Vasilecatalinprodan-tech/Dr.-Vas-AI/pull/4
- Not merged and not deployed. Production remains unchanged until the PR can be reviewed and validated through the deployment workflow. The exact browser-side root cause and successful recovery on the founder's browser remain unconfirmed.
- Next: run the repository's production validation/deploy workflow against the approved hotfix, then ask the founder to reload the live page and confirm the homepage and language selector work. If the fail-open reveals the interface but another feature is still broken, diagnose that separately rather than treating visibility as proof of full health.
