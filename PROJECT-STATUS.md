# Dr.Vas AI — Project Status

Last updated: 2026-11-02
Working branch: `drvas-integrated-platform`

## Product direction

Dr.Vas is one integrated platform, with a web app, Android app (APK), and a later Google Play release. It is not intended to be split into unrelated projects.

Modules:
- **Dr.Vas Free** — free general-purpose AI assistant.
- **Dr.Vas Health** — free general health information and education; it does not replace a clinician.
- **Dr.Vas Studio** — premium creative production for video and social media.
- **Dr.Vas Academy** — premium entrepreneurship education.
- **Dr.Vas Commerce** — premium e-commerce and dropshipping education/tools.
- **Dr.Vas Business** — premium business planning, analysis and management support.

Free and Health are active. Studio, Academy, Commerce and Business remain gated while subscriptions and their full features are developed.

## Technical environment

- GitHub repository: `Vasilecatalinprodan-tech/Dr.-Vas-AI`
- Active branch: `drvas-integrated-platform`
- Cloudflare Worker service: `drvas-ai`
- Production Worker: `https://drvas-ai.vasilecatalinprodan.workers.dev`
- Health endpoint: `https://drvas-ai.vasilecatalinprodan.workers.dev/health`
- Frontend: `www/index.html`
- Worker source: `worker/index.js`
- Supabase project URL is configured in Worker settings and frontend; never place service-role keys or provider secrets in frontend code.
- GitHub Actions deployment workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml` (manual workflow dispatch).

## Existing capabilities and decisions

- Supabase authentication and user profile flow.
- Conversation history and memory support in the Worker.
- Gemini-backed assistant with model fallback and timeout handling.
- Health module safety instructions and UK emergency guidance.
- Premium module server-side gate remains enabled.
- Studio has a dedicated creative-director/screenwriter/social-media-planner instruction set. It can create concepts, series bibles, episode outlines and scripts, character arcs, dialogue, production notes, captions, hooks, hashtags, schedules and prompts for separate video/image tools. It does not yet render finished videos.
- Founder story is factual: Vasile-Cătălin Prodan (Cătălin/Vas), approximately 25 years in Romanian public/political life, including adviser and personal courier work for a Botoșani MP; more than 8 years as a Senior Healthcare Assistant in the UK NHS (not a doctor). “Dr.” is a nickname from colleagues. Jan is a virtual AI collaborator, not a human co-founder. Do not disclose private health/family details in public founder copy.

## Studio publishing objective

The founder wants a dedicated administrator area, visible only to the authorized administrator after login, to manage a TikTok and Instagram content workflow:
- TikTok account currently remains **Personal**. Do not change it to Business without a fresh discussion; the Creator Rewards programme requires a Personal account.
- Current TikTok audience reported by founder: approximately 3,000 followers.
- Growth objective: 10,000+ followers, while noting that follower count alone does not guarantee monetization. Creator Rewards also has recent-view, originality, account-standing and video-length criteria.
- Target production cadence: two original serial episodes daily, one in the morning and one in the evening.
- The founder must review and approve each episode before publishing.
- No social account is connected yet; no scheduled or automatic publishing is currently active.
- TikTok public posting through its Content Posting API requires official developer configuration and app approval/audit; unaudited clients can be restricted to private posting. Do not promise public auto-publishing until approved.
- Instagram API publishing requires an eligible Professional account and official Meta permissions. Do not claim a Personal Instagram account can be published to via the same API.
- Avoid repetitive/low-quality mass posting and respect each platform's content and monetization rules.

## Work completed on 2026-11-02

1. Confirmed the founder's TikTok account is Personal and agreed to keep it Personal for now.
2. Added a server-side administrator-status endpoint to `worker/index.js`:
   - Accepts `action: "admin_status"` with a Supabase access token.
   - Verifies the token with Supabase Auth.
   - Checks the authenticated email against the Cloudflare Worker environment secret `ADMIN_EMAILS` (comma-separated allowlist).
   - Returns only whether the current user is an administrator; does not expose the allowlist.
3. Added a hidden Dr.Vas Studio administrator panel to `www/index.html`:
   - Frontend asks the Worker to verify admin status after login.
   - Panel is revealed only if the Worker returns `is_admin: true`.
   - Shows TikTok Personal, Instagram connection state, and the two-episodes-per-day target.
   - Clearly states that social connections and automatic publishing are not yet active.
4. Ran JavaScript syntax checks for both modified files; checks passed.
5. Fetched the branch files again and confirmed both changes are present.

Latest code commits:
- Worker admin verification: `04fa871ca112e942baf81f1c2b1d022fa8b2bfba`
- Frontend admin panel: `f5a6baa9516410ca52108b69ba2301fa3c18f539`

## Required next steps

1. Ask the founder for the exact email address used to log into Dr.Vas. Do not guess it or hard-code it.
2. Add that email as the Cloudflare Worker secret `ADMIN_EMAILS` (use Cloudflare dashboard or Wrangler secret management; never commit it to Git).
3. Deploy the latest branch and test:
   - Authorized founder account sees the admin panel.
   - A normal account does not see it.
   - The Worker never trusts a frontend-only admin flag.
4. Build persistent Studio data and workflows: episode queue, draft status, approval/rejection, schedule in Europe/London, publication log and retry/error handling.
5. Implement official OAuth connections for TikTok and Meta; store tokens securely server-side and support revocation/refresh.
6. Integrate a video rendering/voice/subtitle pipeline. Current Studio engine produces text/scripts/prompts, not final video files.
7. Only enable scheduled public publishing after each platform's app review/permissions and user approval are in place.

## Important guardrails

- Do not expose admin access based only on a client-side flag or a hard-coded password in the page.
- Do not store social access tokens in localStorage or frontend source.
- Do not unlock Premium modules before subscription verification is implemented.
- Do not claim an integration, video render, publication, or deployment succeeded until it has been tested.
- Continue on `drvas-integrated-platform` and inspect the current files before making further edits.
